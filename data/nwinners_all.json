Their assignment was to seek a solid-state alternative to fragile glass <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Vacuum_tube\" title=\"Vacuum tube\">vacuum tube<\/a> amplifiers. Its first attempts were based on Shockley's ideas about using an external electrical field on a semiconductor to affect its conductivity.

Moore built a circuit that allowed them to vary the frequency of the input signal easily.

He wrote more than sixty plays, including major works such as <i><a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Man_and_Superman\" title=\"Man and Superman\">Man and Superman<\/a><\/i> (1902), <i><a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Pygmalion_(play)\" title=\"Pygmalion (play)\">Pygmalion<\/a><\/i> (1912) <i>and <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Saint_Joan_(play)\" title=\"Saint Joan (play)\">Saint Joan<\/a><\/i> (1923). With a range incorporating both contemporary satire and historical allegory, Shaw became the leading dramatist of his generation, and in 1925 was awarded the <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Nobel_Prize_in_Literature\" title=\"Nobel Prize in Literature\">Nobel Prize in Literature<\/a>.<\/p><p>Born in <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Dublin\" title=\"Dublin\">Dublin<\/a>, Shaw moved to London in 1876, where he struggled to establish himself as a writer and novelist, and embarked on a rigorous process of self-education. By the mid-1880s he had become a respected theatre and music critic. Following a political awakening, he joined the <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Gradualism#Politics_and_society\" title=\"Gradualism\">gradualist<\/a> <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Fabian_Society\" title=\"Fabian Society\">Fabian Society<\/a> and became its most prominent pamphleteer. Shaw had been writing plays for years before his first public success, <i><a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Arms_and_the_Man\" title=\"Arms and the Man\">Arms and the Man<\/a><\/i> in 1894. Influenced by <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Henrik_Ibsen\" title=\"Henrik Ibsen\">Henrik Ibsen<\/a>, he sought to introduce a new realism into English-language drama, using his plays as vehicles to disseminate his political, social and religious ideas. By the early twentieth century his reputation as a dramatist was secured with a series of critical and popular successes that included <i><a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Major_Barbara\" title=\"Major Barbara\">Major Barbara<\/a><\/i>, <i><a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/The_Doctor%27s_Dilemma_(play)\" title=\"The Doctor's Dilemma (play)\">The Doctor's Dilemma<\/a><\/i> and <i><a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Caesar_and_Cleopatra_(play)\" title=\"Caesar and Cleopatra (play)\">Caesar and Cleopatra<\/a><\/i>.<\/p><p>Shaw's expressed views were often contentious; he promoted <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Eugenics\" title=\"Eugenics\">eugenics<\/a> and alphabet reform, and opposed <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Vaccination\" title=\"Vaccination\">vaccination<\/a> and organised religion. He courted unpopularity by denouncing both sides in the <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/First_World_War\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"First World War\">First World War<\/a> as equally culpable, and although not a <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Irish_republicanism\" title=\"Irish republicanism\">republican<\/a>, castigated British policy on Ireland in the postwar period. These stances had no lasting effect on his standing or productivity as a dramatist; the inter-war years saw a series of often ambitious plays, which achieved varying degrees of popular success. In 1938 he provided the screenplay for a filmed version of <i>Pygmalion<\/i> for which he received an <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Academy_Award_for_Best_Adapted_Screenplay\" title=\"Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay\">Academy Award<\/a>. His appetite for politics and controversy remained undiminished; by the late 1920s he had largely renounced Fabian gradualism and often wrote and spoke favourably of dictatorships of the right and left\u2014he expressed admiration for both <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Benito_Mussolini\" title=\"Benito Mussolini\">Mussolini<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Joseph_Stalin\" title=\"Joseph Stalin\">Stalin<\/a>. In the final decade of his life he made fewer public statements, but continued to write prolifically until shortly before his death, aged ninety-four, having refused all state honours including the <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Order_of_Merit\" title=\"Order of Merit\">Order of Merit<\/a> in 1946.<\/p><p>Since Shaw's death scholarly and critical opinion has varied about his works, but he has regularly been rated as second only to <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/William_Shakespeare\" title=\"William Shakespeare\">Shakespeare<\/a> among British dramatists; analysts recognise his extensive influence on generations of English-language playwrights.

Opposed to the 1948 creation of the <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Israel\" title=\"Israel\">State of Israel<\/a>, he fought alongside the <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Muslim_Brotherhood\" title=\"Muslim Brotherhood\">Muslim Brotherhood<\/a> during the <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/1948_Arab%E2%80%93Israeli_War\" title=\"1948 Arab\u2013Israeli War\">1948 Arab\u2013Israeli War<\/a>. Returning to Cairo, he served as president of the <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/General_Union_of_Palestinian_Students\" title=\"General Union of Palestinian Students\">General Union of Palestinian Students<\/a> from 1952 to 1956. In the latter part of the 1950s he co-founded Fatah, a paramilitary organisation seeking the disestablishment of Israel and its replacement with a Palestinian state. Fatah operated within several Arab countries, from where it launched attacks on Israeli targets. In the latter part of the 1960s Arafat's profile grew; in 1967 he joined the PLO and in 1969 was elected chair of the <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Palestinian_National_Council\" title=\"Palestinian National Council\">Palestinian National Council<\/a> (PNC). Fatah's growing presence in Jordan resulted in military clashes with <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Hussein_of_Jordan\" title=\"Hussein of Jordan\">King Hussein<\/a>'s Jordanian government and in the early 1970s it relocated to Lebanon.

In 1988, he <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/UN_Security_Council_Resolution_242\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"UN Security Council Resolution 242\">acknowledged<\/a> Israel's right to exist and sought a <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Two-state_solution\" title=\"Two-state solution\">two-state solution<\/a> to the <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Israeli%E2%80%93Palestinian_conflict\" title=\"Israeli\u2013Palestinian conflict\">Israeli\u2013Palestinian conflict<\/a>.

These included the <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Madrid_Conference_of_1991\" title=\"Madrid Conference of 1991\">Madrid Conference of 1991<\/a>, the 1993 <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Oslo_Accords\" title=\"Oslo Accords\">Oslo Accords<\/a> and the <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/2000_Camp_David_Summit\" title=\"2000 Camp David Summit\">2000 Camp David Summit<\/a>.

The distance between the two points was about 2,200 miles (3,500\u00a0km). It was heralded as a great scientific advance, yet there also was\u2014and continues to be\u2014considerable scepticism about this claim. The exact wavelength used is not known, but it is fairly reliably determined to have been in the neighbourhood of 350 meters (frequency \u2248850\u00a0kHz). The tests took place at a time of day during which the entire transatlantic path was in daylight. We now know (although Marconi did not know then) that this was the worst possible choice. At this medium wavelength, long distance transmission in the daytime is not possible because of heavy absorption of the skywave in the ionosphere. It was not a blind test; Marconi knew in advance to listen for a repetitive signal of three clicks, signifying the Morse code letter <i>S<\/i>. The clicks were reported to have been heard faintly and sporadically. There was no independent confirmation of the reported reception, and the transmissions were difficult to distinguish from atmospheric noise. (A detailed technical review of Marconi's early transatlantic work appears in John S. Belrose's work of 1995.) The Poldhu transmitter was a two-stage circuit.<sup id=\"cite_ref-35\" class=\"reference\"><a https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Guglielmo_Marconi#cite_note-35\">[35]<\/a><\/sup><sup id=\"cite_ref-36\" class=\"reference\"><a https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Guglielmo_Marconi#cite_note-36\">[36]<\/a><\/sup><\/p><p>Feeling challenged by <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Scientific_skepticism\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Scientific skepticism\">skeptics<\/a>, Marconi prepared a better organised and documented test. In February 1902, the SS <i>Philadelphia<\/i> sailed west from Great Britain with Marconi aboard, carefully recording signals sent daily from the Poldhu station. The test results produced <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Magnetic_detector\" title=\"Magnetic detector\">coherer-tape<\/a> reception up to 1,550 miles (2,490\u00a0km), and audio reception up to 2,100 miles (3,400\u00a0km). The maximum distances were achieved at night, and these tests were the first to show that radio signals for <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Medium_wave\" title=\"Medium wave\">medium wave<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Longwave\" title=\"Longwave\">longwave<\/a> transmissions travel much farther at night than in the day. During the daytime, signals had been received up to only about 700 miles (1,100\u00a0km), less than half of the distance claimed earlier at Newfoundland, where the transmissions had also taken place during the day. Because of this, Marconi had not fully confirmed the Newfoundland claims, although he did prove that radio signals could be sent for hundreds of kilometres, despite some scientists' belief that they were limited essentially to line-of-sight distances.<\/p><p>On 17 December 1902, a transmission from the Marconi station in <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Glace_Bay\" title=\"Glace Bay\">Glace Bay<\/a>, Nova Scotia, Canada became the world's first radio message to cross the Atlantic from North America.

Along with <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Robert_Hofstadter\" title=\"Robert Hofstadter\">Robert Hofstadter<\/a>, Rudolf M\u00f6ssbauer was awarded the 1961 Nobel Prize in Physics.<\/p><p>On the suggestion of <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Richard_Feynman\" title=\"Richard Feynman\">Richard Feynman<\/a>, M\u00f6ssbauer was invited in 1960 to <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Caltech\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Caltech\">Caltech<\/a>, where he advanced rapidly from Research Fellow to Senior Research Fellow; he was appointed a full professor of physics in early 1962. In 1964, his alma mater, the <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Technische_Universit%C3%A4t_M%C3%BCnchen\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Technische Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen\">Technical University of Munich<\/a> (TUM), convinced him to go back as a full professor. He retained this position until he became <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Professor_emeritus\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Professor emeritus\">professor emeritus<\/a> in 1997. As a condition for his return, the faculty of physics introduced a \"department\" system. This system, strongly influenced by M\u00f6ssbauer's American experience, was in radical contrast to the traditional, hierarchical \"faculty\" system of German universities, and it gave the TUM an eminent position in German physics.<\/p><p>In 1972, Rudolf M\u00f6ssbauer went to Grenoble to succeed Heinz Maier-Leibnitz as the director of the <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Institut_Laue-Langevin\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Institut Laue-Langevin\">Institut Laue-Langevin<\/a> just when its newly built high-flux <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Research_reactor\" title=\"Research reactor\">research reactor<\/a> went into operation. After serving a 5-year term, M\u00f6ssbauer returned to Munich, where he found his institutional reforms reversed by overarching legislation. Until the end of his career, he often expressed bitterness over this \"destruction of the department.\" Meanwhile, his research interests shifted to <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Neutrino\" title=\"Neutrino\">neutrino<\/a> physics.<\/p><p>Rudolf M\u00f6ssbauer was an excellent teacher. He gave highly specialized lectures on numerous courses, including <i>Neutrino Physics,<\/i> <i>Neutrino Oscillations,<\/i> <i>The Unification of the Electromagnetic and Weak Interactions<\/i> and <i>The Interaction of Photons and Neutrons With Matter.<\/i> In 1984, he gave undergraduate lectures to 350 people taking the physics course. He told his students: \u201cExplain it! The most important thing is, that you are able to explain it! You will have exams, there you have to explain it. Eventually, you pass them, you get your diploma and you think, that's it! \u2013 No, the whole life is an exam, you'll have to write applications, you'll have to discuss with peers... So learn to explain it! You can train this by explaining to another student, a colleague. If they are not available, explain it to your mother \u2013 or to your cat!\u201d<\/p>"},{"category":"Physics","country":"Germany","date_of_birth":"1907-06-25T00:00:00.000Z","date_of_death":"1973-02-11T00:00:00.000Z","gender":"male","link":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/J._Hans_D._Jensen","name":"J.

Firstly, instead of the body producing antibodies in response to an antigen, Jerne postulated that the immune system already has the specific antibodies it needs to fight antigens. Secondly, it was known that the immune system learns to be tolerant to the individual's own self. Jerne postulated that this learning takes place in the thymus. Thirdly, it was known that T cells and B cells communicate with each other. Jerne's network theory proposed that the active sites of antibodies are attracted to both specific antigens (idiotypes) and to other antibodies that bind to the same site. The antibodies are in balance, until an antigen disturbs the balance, stimulating an immune reaction.<\/p>"},{"category":"Peace","country":"Egypt","date_of_birth":"1918-12-25T00:00:00.000Z","date_of_death":"1981-10-06T00:00:00.000Z","gender":"male","link":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Anwar_Sadat","name":"Anwar Sadat","place_of_birth":"Nile Delta","place_of_death":"Cairo","text":"Anwar Sadat , Peace, 1978","year":1978.0,"born_in":null,"award_age":60.0,"death_age":"1970-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","bio_image":"full\/7ffc856ffcfc8b8cbbad78b51e877785c2a1d510.jpg","image_urls":["https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/thumb\/b\/b0\/Anwar_Sadat_cropped.jpg\/220px-Anwar_Sadat_cropped.jpg"],"mini_bio":"<p><b>Muhammad Anwar el-Sadat<\/b> (<a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Arabic_language\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Arabic language\">Arabic<\/a>: <span lang=\"ar\" dir=\"rtl\" xml:lang=\"ar\">\u0645\u062d\u0645\u062f \u0623\u0646\u0648\u0631 \u0627\u0644\u0633\u0627\u062f\u0627\u062a<\/span>\u200e\u200e <i><span title=\"ar ALA transliteration\" class=\"Unicode\" style=\"white-space:normal; text-decoration: none\">Mu\u1e25ammad Anwar as-S\u0101d\u0101t<\/span><\/i>, <small>Egyptian<\/small> <small>Arabic pronunciation:\u00a0<\/small><span title=\"Representation in the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA)\" class=\"IPA\"><a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Help:IPA\/Arabic\" title=\"Help:IPA\/Arabic\">[m\u00e6\u02c8\u0127\u00e6mm\u00e6d \u02c8\u0294\u0251nw\u0251\u027e ess\u00e6\u02c8d\u00e6\u02d0t]<\/a><\/span>; 25 December 1918\u00a0\u2013 6 October 1981) was the <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/List_of_Presidents_of_Egypt\" title=\"List of Presidents of Egypt\">third President of Egypt<\/a>, serving from 15 October 1970 until his <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Assassination_of_Anwar_Sadat\" title=\"Assassination of Anwar Sadat\">assassination<\/a> by fundamentalist army officers on 6 October 1981.

As the authorities were unable to build a strong case against him, he spent much of the war under <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/House_arrest\" title=\"House arrest\">house arrest<\/a>, only being released following a general amnesty for such cases in July 1917.

Shortly after the invasion, Andri\u0107 returned to German-occupied <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Belgrade\" title=\"Belgrade\">Belgrade<\/a>. He lived quietly in a friend's apartment for the duration of World War II, in conditions that some biographers liken to house arrest, and wrote some of his most important works, including <i><a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/The_Bridge_on_the_Drina\" title=\"The Bridge on the Drina\">Na Drini \u0107uprija<\/a><\/i> (<i>The Bridge on the Drina<\/i>).<\/p><p>Following the war, Andri\u0107 was named to a number of ceremonial posts in Yugoslavia, which had come under communist rule at the war's end.

Afterwards, Andri\u0107's works found an international audience and were translated into a number of languages. In subsequent years, he received a number of awards in his native country. Andri\u0107's health declined substantially in late 1974, and he died in Belgrade the following March.<\/p><p>In the years following Andri\u0107's death, the Belgrade apartment where he spent much of World War II was converted into a museum and a nearby street corner was named in his honour. A number of other cities in the former <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Yugoslavia\" title=\"Yugoslavia\">Yugoslavia<\/a> also have streets bearing his name. In 2012, filmmaker <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Emir_Kusturica\" title=\"Emir Kusturica\">Emir Kusturica<\/a> began construction of an ethno-town in eastern Bosnia that is <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Andri%C4%87grad\" title=\"Andri\u0107grad\">named after Andri\u0107<\/a>.
